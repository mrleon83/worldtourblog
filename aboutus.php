		Greetings! We, Cat and Leon are indulging you into a little insight to where we have come from, and a flavor of our souls… but I guess if you’re on this page you probably already know us at least a tiny bit. But here goes; for the nosey, per chancers, and the loyal fans of our very being (we love you bestest!)
		</p>


		<p>
		I think the first thing most people would associate with us is music! It has always been entwined within our relationship and I dare say, always will. We met at a music school, we have always enjoyed live music festivals / gigs together and have played in several local bands. Rock and roll with a randy mole!
		</p>

		<p>
		The second passion of ours has been travelling abroad, so much so that we actually got married in Rhodes, Greece. We have not spawned any kittens, so have had the opportunity to travel Europe quite a bit… but why stop there, I hear.
		</p>

		<p>
		We have always of dreamt of being able to travel the world, but as many people find themselves, we had certain responsibilities with work, mortgages and trying to be what society told us to be. 
		</p>

		<p>
		There were several catalysts for the change. The first was a chat with Leon’s parents over dinner, where they told us about their travels around Europe (before Leon and his sister Ches, were born). We think that is super cool, and realized we wanted to be able to experience these rich and lasting moments that can shape and define your very persona. The additional points that pushed us towards making this move were, that we had sold our house and ready to move into a house in the countryside, but started having doubts about being even more financially burdened. Experiences over stuff has always been a strong belief of both of us. Also, there were some unfortunate circumstances with friends and colleagues leading to a sudden realisation that nothing should be taken for granted. That ideal retirement is not guaranteed. We have had such good advice and guidance from deep conversations with a wise old goat. He told us to ‘LIVE!’. What are we waiting for? We felt it was a now of never moment, being mortgage free, and no dependents or animals.
		</p>

		<p>
		After some persuasion, Leon came round to the idea and became more amenable to the adventure with a compromise of two months, as see how we go from there. We decided this would be a good way to test our spirits and open ourselves to opportunity, while still having the support of Cat’s workplace, as they are unbelievably keeping the post open. Shout out to DW Roberts staff &amp; the owner, Allan. THANK YOU for letting us live our dream, and grow as people.
		</p>
		<p>
		Cat’s parents kindly took us into their home (little…well younger brother John even gave up his room for most of the time). That we will be forever grateful for, so that we are able to experience a larger scale of travelling and growth. 
		We also joined a website called ‘trusted house sitters’. This was to get an insight into other people’s way of living, know what it is like to live in different areas, and to educate us better in our future decisions when choosing a place to call home.
		</p>

		<p>
		So that’s our story, &amp; we have written our individual blurbs about each other as it is always a bit dull to talk about one’s self!
		</p>

		<p>
		Leon: This is an introduction to my lovely husband Leon; he is a very kind and humble soul and true gentleman (a credit to his wonderful &amp; supportive parents, Jacky &amp; Andy, and his beloved Grandparents, who I know will be just as proud of him). He is truly the most talented musician I have had the pleasure to listen to &amp; play with and also can be as stubborn as a mule! Yes, I am talking about your indication ‘logic’ on roundabouts! I am so very proud that he has taken the leap to become a Web Developer and pushed himself further than he probably thought he was ever capable of. I have really seen him blossom since learning to drive (better late than never eh! Pot-kettle LOL). May we continue to share wonderful memories and moments together for the rest of our lives. THANK YOU for agreeing to come on the journey of my dreams. Well, you should have married a nice little tame house wife if you didn’t want the ride of your life ;)
		</p>

		<p>
		Cat: Ok, so I’m not as articulate as my beautiful wife of 11 years (together 16) but here we go. Cat is caring, selfless, tenacious, intelligent and crazy good fun to be around. She inspires me, pushes me and keeps me on my toes on a daily basis. Without Cat, I would not have got into Web Development and certainly would not have learnt to drive this year.  Cat is super driven to do whatever she wants. She achieved incredible results in her Dispensing Optician qualification (oh yeah, can we mention Cat FBDO QTLS) and is incredible at her job. That’s another thing, and I need to get a hang of this. If Cat has an idea, (teaching Optics in London, teaching maths in the devil’s bumhole that is Milton Keynes, or nursery nursing) she will just do it, nothing gets in her way and she is awesome! During our most recent holiday (at time of writing, Tenerife), we had issues with the accommodation being 10 miles from the location given, we rolled with the punches and got stuff sorted in searing heat –  with little sweat - I know this journey will have its craziness, but I know we’ll smash it together! … Onwards and upwards here’s to the experiences to come up! 
		</p>

		<p>
		One last thing we would both like to say is thank-you to our amazing friends and family who have been so encouraging!
